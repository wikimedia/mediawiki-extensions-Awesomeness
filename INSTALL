Latest version of the install file: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/gitweb?p=mediawiki/extensions/Awesomeness.git;a=blob;f=INSTALL


== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''Awesomeness'' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# Awesomeness
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Awesomeness/Awesomeness.php" );

Note that awesomeness now requires you to have PHP 5.3 or later and MediaWiki 1.17 or later.
If you're wiki is not awesome enough, you'll have to get an older, less awesome version, of awesomeness.
